## [Headings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)

Headings are used to define a section heading.
|Type | Self-closing|
|-----|-------------|
|Block|No |

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Browsers apply different sizes for each heading in their default CSS rules. Keep in mind that HTML is about content and not the styling. Never use an h4 after an h2. For example, always keep a descendant order (h1 > h2 > h3‚Ä¶).

#### ‚úÖ Accessibility tip

- Headings are used by voice browser to help navigate through the webpage.

```html
<h1>This is my title level 1</h1>
<h2>This is my title level 2</h2>
...
```

#### üî∞ Tip

- Never put the logo or name of your website inside an `<h1>`. The text inside this tag has to reflect the content of your page. On a homepage, based on the design, you can eventually hide visually your `<h1>` but it still has to exist in your code.
